{"name":"HIE of One","tagline":"Your personal UMA Authorization Server","body":"Application Programming Interfaces or APIs are everywhere from your electronic health record, to your car, to your wearable, and even to your implant. These APIs share your most personal information via the Internet and are typically subject to your consent through a so-called Authorization Server. The Authorization Server is, in the legal sense, acting as your Agent and follows well established Agency Law. \r\n\r\nAll sorts of businesses, including Apple, Google, and Facebook are eager to serve as your Authorization Agent because they benefit from access to your personal data. But that benefit also comes at a cost to your privacy and represents a business risk to the hospital or Thing manufacturer that would prefer to have a direct relationship with you as the customer.\r\n\r\nAs Web API standards are now available, a new opportunity arises in the provision of a standardized _personal_ Authorization Server. As with other personal agents such as your Firefox browser, or Freedom Box personal cloud, the project weâ€™re calling HIE of One will be open source and owned by nobody but you. \r\n\r\nThis consumer-focused implementation of the UMA Authorization Server will not force the person to accept a broker or other institution as her agent with all of the privacy risks and potential conflicts of interest that entails.","google":"UA-69980311-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
